# Hyposcript
Hyposcript is a custom programming language by Jobayer Islam Jarif that uses hyphens (-) and underscores (_) to represent letters, numbers, and symbols. Spaces are denoted by ___. Each character has a unique pattern, making Hyposcript simple, creative, and lightweight for encoding and experimentation.
